# Personal Site

This is the code for my personal site hosted on github pages.

The goal of this is to create a website showcasing all my projects and also serve as a living document of sort, which I can continue to improve as I learn more about web dev.

### To-Do:

- Make site responsive (possible Bootstrap implementation).
- Redesign the UX.
- Create a blog section / or to link one.
- Implement logo design.

### Known Issues:

- Site does not behave properly in landscape on mobile screens
